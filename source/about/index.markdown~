I'm a language scientist.  No, really, I'm a research scientist that works on language.  Specifically, issues in language learning, language processing, language aptitude, and other topics.

This blog is a place for me to share my informal thoughts on language and language science, and a place to share ideas and resources for data analysis and reproducible research.

Hope you enjoy!
