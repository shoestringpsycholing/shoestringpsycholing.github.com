Alright, I'm about a decade or so late, but I'm starting a blog.

*"Shoestring Psycholing"*, really? Yeah, well...

For some reason this name has stuck in my head for a few years now. I like the idea of science, especially language science, being something accessible and open to all sorts of people. More and more, the tools to do even things like experimental psycholinguistics has become cheaper and easier.  So the idea of "dirt cheap psycholinguistics" is somehow appealing, and Shoestring Psycholing is a kind of near-rhyme with a catchy rhythm... anyhoo, I'm sure this is one of those things I'll look back on and groan at, but it's been stuck in my head for so long, I might as well get it out in the open.

That's what this is all about, by the way: getting things out of my weird little head and out into the open.  Hopefully along the way it'll provide something interesting or helpful for someone else.  In the meantime, thanks for tagging along for the ride!
